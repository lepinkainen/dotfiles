  Write a descriptive commit message following the Conventional Commits specification (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) describing the changes in the following diff.

  Keep the commit message brief, but informative. Avoid stating the obvious. Focus on important changes a reviewer would care about. Use lowercase for the description (no string delimiters wrapping it, no markdown, no semicolons). Don't add fluff.

  Select the appropriate type based on the changes:
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - docs: Documentation only changes
  - style: Code style changes (whitespace, formatting)
  - refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - perf: Performance improvement
  - test: Adding or correcting tests
  - build: Changes to build system or dependencies
  - ci: Changes to CI configuration
  - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
